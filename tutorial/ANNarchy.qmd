## Neuro-simulators

There already exist several neuro-simulators for computational neuroscience, each which different levels of description (detailed, spiking, rate-coded, etc.) or supported hardware (CPU, GPU). 


Some simulators provide fixed libraries of neural and synaptic models:

* **NEURON** <https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/>
    * Multi-compartmental models, spiking neurons (CPU)
* **GENESIS** <http://genesis-sim.org/>
    * Multi-compartmental models, spiking neurons (CPU) -->
* **NEST** <https://nest-initiative.org/>
    * Spiking neurons (CPU)
* **GeNN** <https://genn-team.github.io/genn/>
    * Spiking neurons (GPU)
* **Auryn** <https://fzenke.net/auryn/doku.php>
    * Spiking neurons (CPU)


Some rely instead on code generation:

* **Brian** <https://briansimulator.org/>
    * Spiking neurons (CPU)
* **Brian2CUDA** <https://github.com/brian-team/brian2cuda>
    * Spiking neurons (GPU)
* **ANNarchy** <https://github.com/ANNarchy/ANNarchy>
    * Rate-coded and spiking neurons (CPU, GPU)

### Installation

Installation guide: <https://annarchy.github.io/Installation/>

Using pip:

```bash
pip install ANNarchy
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ANNarchy/ANNarchy.git
cd annarchy
pip install -e .
```

Requirements (Linux and MacOS):

* g++/clang++
* python >= 3.6
* numpy
* sympy
* cython


### Features

* Simulation of both **rate-coded** and **spiking** neural networks.

* Only local biologically realistic mechanisms are possible (no backpropagation).

* **Equation-oriented** description of neural/synaptic dynamics (à la Brian).

* **Code generation** in C++, parallelized using OpenMP on CPU and CUDA on GPU (MPI is coming).

* Synaptic, intrinsic and structural plasticity mechanisms.

### Structure of a script

A neuro-computational model in ANNarchy is composed of:

1. Several **populations** implementing different **neuron** models.
2. Several **projections** between the populations, that can implement specific **synapse** models.
3. **Monitors** to record what is happening during a simulation.

The following script provides the basic structure of a model. First, the neuron and synapse models have to be defined using the equation-oriented interface. Populations are then created and connected with each other using projections. The network can then be generated and compiled, before the simulation can start. 

```python
from ANNarchy import *

# Create neuron types
neuron = Neuron(...) 

# Create synapse types for transmission and/or plasticity
stdp = Synapse(...) 

# Create populations of neurons
pop = Population(1000, neuron) 

# Connect the populations through projections
proj = Projection(pop, pop, 'exc', stdp) 
proj.connect_fixed_probability(weights=Uniform(0.0, 1.0), probability=0.1)

# Generate and compile the code
compile() 

# Record spiking activity
m = Monitor(pop, ['spike']) 

# Simulate for 1 second
simulate(1000.)
```

The rest of this tutorial explains step by step how to implement those different mechanisms, starting with rate-coded networks, followed by spiking networks.
